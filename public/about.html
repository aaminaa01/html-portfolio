<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Aamina: reader, writer, and incidentally a Software Engineer in the making as well. I enjoy writing short pieces
  on topics like the transience of life, the wonder of experiences, and the mysterious tactics of time. If you too like dabbling into topics like these, you might like my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_petrichoratdusk/?next=%2F">Instagram page</a>,
   where I spurt out some semblance of prose sometimes. I'm interested in government, policy,
   and social work, and hope to leverage my tech degree in those domains. Thanks for stopping by!
